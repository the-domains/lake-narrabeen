Nearly every morning I arrive at the bus stop near my home, which is fortuitously on the north western edge of Narrabeen Lagoon in Sydney, Australia.

It started after spotting some amazing sunrises, and soon I had a new habit. So now nearly every weekday morning, if I remember and the conditions are ok then I snap a few pics using my mobile phone.
